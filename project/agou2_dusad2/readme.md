# Final Project:

## Draft

https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6692-safe-model-based-reinforcement-learning-with-stability-guarantees



## Requirements:

1. **Put in a draft of what algo, what system, and what you're hoping your contrubuition is** 
2. Implement state of the art stuff on an actual system that we care about 
3. Some degree of innovation in both areas 
4. EG: 
   1. Using recurrent NN and see how memory is working on agent training, on a system like the multi link pendulum 
   2. just TRPO to a complicated problem 
5. Should be an existing paper from the literature that you're using as basis 
   1. Preferably you do some research on this and this is a new paper 
   2. doesn't have to be RL only
      1. can look at eg control research 
6. RL algorithm should be implemented from scratch 
7. System model can have different stuff
   1. Use the system most common for the research 
   2. pybullet, mujoco, 
8. Platforms and libs okay to use, but implement the algo completely 
9. Important to get shit to work



TL;DR 

1. Identify the system you want to apply to
2. Fix on one-two key reference papers
