Project Idea 1 : 

Entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning: Change the regularization terms (Shannon Entropy, KL Divergence) to mutual information and observe the improvement. Motivation comes from the Deterministic Annealing algorithm, applicable to clustering, where the clustering solution improves upon using the mutual information as a regularizer. 

We will have to find the class of problems where this change in regularization term will be beneficial.

Project idea 2:

We’ll be using reinforcement learning for solving temperature control problems in heat exchangers in the presence of wide-ranging uncertainties of input variables. The problem is a continuous control problem. Further, we’ll also be exploring the idea of RL for adaptively tuning control parameters of PI for process control applications
