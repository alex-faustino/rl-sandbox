# AE598-RL Project
I plan to extend the part of results presented in ICRA-2018. In previous paper we demonstrated the policy transfer between two different domain tasks like mountain-car to Inverted-Pendulum and Cart-Pole to Bicycle. Also the policies transfered was for discrete action space, where the source policy was generated using DQN. For the class project I would be extending the proposed  Adaptive Transfer of Reinforcement learning policies for continuous action spaces between similar tasks with model uncertainties.

Experiments: Hopper-v1/HalfCheetah-v1/Ant-v1 ( using OpenAI RoboSchool )
Source Policy: DDPG/PPO


# Installation
