Final project

individual or pairs (higher qualification)

Apply: 1 method, 1 system, 1 paper

every one should konw how the algorithm work, not just division of work

can use arXiv to search relevant paper, also can search paper from conference: ICLR, NIPS, ICML, ICRA, RSS

some things haven't been done

like robotic simulation

can use library and platform (but not copy): pytorch, tensorflow, PPO, MuJoCo

try some thing relatively simple, achievable

AWS (dynamic simulation)

create a folder and README about some draft statement: what algorithm, what system

3 weeks later project paper presentation
