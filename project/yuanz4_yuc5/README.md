Final project

individual or pairs (higher qualification)

Apply: 1 method, 1 system, 1 paper

every one should konw how the algorithm work, not just division of work

can use arXiv to search relevant paper, also can search paper from conference: ICLR, NIPS, ICML, ICRA, RSS

some things haven't been done

like robotic simulation

can use library and platform (but not copy): pytorch, tensorflow, PPO, MuJoCo

try some thing relatively simple, achievable

AWS (dynamic simulation)

create a folder and README about some draft statement: what algorithm, what system

3 weeks later project paper presentation

# PingPong upward srtike (table juggling)

2-D or 3-D for board or ball? Or how many degrees of freedom? tilted?

friction needed?

Physical simulation: Mujoco not open-source. Option: c++ bullet, pybullet, roboschool, v-rep

PPO is good for continuous states

need to concern the computation speed, physical engine from outside or inside?

# Project Paper Presentation

10-15 minutes, choose a reference paper

5 minutes on what this paper is about, 5 minutes on what our project is about (implement this algorithm or other)

result presentation: ipynb is preferred (compared with PDF)
