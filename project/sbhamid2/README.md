# Urban Path Planning to Minimize GPS Integrity Risk Using Proximal Policy Optimization 

## Motivation and Objectives
GPS plays a pivotal role in the navigation of autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and so on. GPS Navigation in urban areas suffer from multipath, satellite blockage and signal attenuation due to the presence of tall buildings. Given the grid layout of the urban areas, multiple routes are feasible to reach from a start point to an end point. Therefore, the objective of this work is to perform path planning to minimize the GPS integrity risk, while navigating in urban areas
