This code implements the Q Learning and SARSA

Q Learning and SARSA

User Inputs to grid world Env:

1) mode  Easy = True/False
This selection chooses between probabilistic and determinitic GridWorld model

maxEpisode = 5000
epLength = 50 (Since there is no terminal state, I restrict each epsiode to be of length 50)
epsilon = 0.3
epsilon decay = 0.999
gamma = 0.99
learning rate = 0.05
