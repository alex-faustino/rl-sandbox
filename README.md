# RL Sandbox
This repo serves as my playground for reinforcement learning methods, algorithms, and experiments. There is no guarantee of correct implementation, optimality, or convergence. Use at your own risk, but really what's the worst that could happen?

### A brief history
This code was all originally for a grad seminar on reinforcement learning, AE/ME 598RL, at UIUC in Fall 2018.
